<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

We need to create a data base, where we will store our data.

I used MySQL Workbench.

### Prerequisites

We need to get node installed in our system.

We will also need a text editor or a bash able to run the commands for building the project.

### Installation

After creating and specifying our data base connection on projects' properties file we will also need to update the libraries and frameworks we used in case
that they are not installed or the installed version is older than the ones used in this project.
