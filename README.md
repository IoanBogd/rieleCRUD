<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a CRUD app served on SpringBoot for a client built with Vue.js.

This is a knowledge proov for Clustag and Rielec's selection process.

We used a PrimeVue stored DataTable with pagination and a bar on it's top with the amount of buttons needed for the CRUD service.
It stores, updates, deletes, and reads the data. With confirmations expected from the user before deleting, it also shows a pop-up window
for recording the data.

### Built With

* [Java][Java.com]
* [SpringBoot][spring.io]
* [Vue][vuejs.org/]
* [PRIMEvue][Primefaces.org/]


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

We need to create a data base, where we will store our data.

I used MySQL Workbench.

We only need one table, called "task", with three columns: 

-Id (Number) PK
-Name (Varchar)
-State (Varchar)

### Prerequisites

We need to get node installed in our system.

We will also need a text editor or a bash able to run the commands for building the project.

### Installation

After creating and specifying our data base connection on projects' properties file we will also need to update the libraries and frameworks we used in case
that they are not installed or the installed version is older than the ones used in this project.
